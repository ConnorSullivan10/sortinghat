# Sorting Hat

## Description
Use this application to discover which house potential Hogwarts students will be assigned to, depending on the name you enter into the sorting hat card builder. Upon entry of the site, click "Let's start sorting" after reading the intro, then enter in the First Year's name into the form that is generated on the next page that pops up, and finally click the "Sort!" button to see the final result. You can enter as many names of first years as you'd like, and if you'd like to expel a student and remove their sorting card, just click the "Expel" button on the card of that student.
